    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p>
      The b tag is an HTML tag used to mark text as bold. It is a formatting tag
      that affects the visual appearance of the enclosed text by making it
      appear in a bold typeface. It is typically used to emphasize or highlight
      important words or phrases within a paragraph or heading.

    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>
      The i tag is an HTML tag used to mark text as italicized. It is a
      formatting tag that changes the visual appearance of the enclosed text by
      displaying it in an italic font style. The i tag is often used to indicate
      emphasis, citations, technical terms, or expressions in a different tone
      or voice.
    </p>
    <h1>u tag</h1>
    <p>
      The u tag is an HTML tag used to underline text. It is a formatting tag
      that applies an underline to the enclosed text. The u tag is primarily
      used to indicate hyperlinks, although it can be used to underline any text
      for stylistic purposes. However, it is generally recommended to use CSS
      for styling text, including underlining, instead of relying on the u tag.

    <h1>select tag</h1>
    <p>
      The select tag is an HTML tag used to create a dropdown list. It is a form
      element that allows users to select one or more options from a list. The
      select tag is often used in conjunction with the option tag, which defines
      the available options within the dropdown menu. It provides a
      user-friendly way to choose from a set of predefined values or select a
      single value from a list.
    </p>
    <h1>button tag</h1>
    <p>
      The button tag is an HTML tag used to create a clickable button on a
      webpage. It is an interactive element that users can click or activate to
      perform a specific action. The button tag can be used within forms to
      submit or reset the form, trigger JavaScript functions, or navigate to
      another page. It can also be styled using CSS to customize its appearance.
    </p>
    <h1>hr tag</h1>
    <p>
      The `hr` tag is an HTML tag used to insert a horizontal rule or line on a
      webpage. It represents a thematic break or a visual separation between
      sections of content. The `hr` tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it does
      not require a closing tag. By default, it creates a horizontal line that
      spans the width of its container, but it can be customized using CSS to
      adjust its size, color, and style.
    </p>
    <h1>br tag</h1>
    <p>
      The br tag is an HTML tag used to insert a line break or newline within a
      text element. It is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.
      When the br tag is used, it forces a line break at that point, causing the
      text or content that follows it to appear on a new line. It is commonly
      used to create line breaks in paragraphs, addresses, or poem stanzas,
      where preserving the line breaks is important.
